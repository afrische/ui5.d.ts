# ui5.d.ts
WIP typings for SAP's OpenUi5

## Usage

I recommend you add this project as a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule) in a project wide 
`typings/`  folder.

## Alternatives

[TimoSta/tern-openui5](https://github.com/TimoSta/tern-openui5) is another way to get code completion. See [ternjs.net](http://ternjs.net/) for a list of compatible editors. 


## Current State

This project is stale. You can still use it, but i haven't updated it for a while now. 

However in the meantime several tools have emerged that can extract typescript defintions from jsdoc comments. Please see the following for more details
